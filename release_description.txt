This version squashes bugs so I can focus on future features! It fixes a ton of little bugs that had been reported: dual SIM issues, drafts being deleted, problems sharing articles and YouTube videos, archive list not allowing you to call, tablets getting out of sync, some notification issues, and some smaller things that users reported.
